<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screen.jpg)


- You can see a demo [here](https://amazing-meitner-009952.netlify.app/)
- This challenge was important to understand the bases of the components in React and how they are optimized to be reused.
- I have learned to handle the logic in the components to optimize the styles applied with the css.

### Built With

The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY) is to optimize the styles of the css to obtain a large number of different buttons through properties similar to boostrap.
